(FIXES TO THE OTHER LIBRARIES)

Hi, I like the library. I've got 2 bugfixes and 3 propositions.

1. After iniparser.c:581, it's missing
if (len < 0) {
  len = 0;
}

2. In iniparser:557-560 use ASCIILINE
SZ+1.

----------------------------------------------------

Hello!

Small bug? If an .ini file does not end in a newline, then a parsing error is generated complaining that the 'line is too long'. So for example:

>>>>>> begin document
[video] ;new line here
fullscreen=false ;NO new line here
<<<<<< end of document

In my copy, I have changed line 567/iniparser.c from:

if (line[len]!='\n') {

to:

if ((ASCIILINESZ-last == len+1) && line[len]!='\n') {
---------------
Actually that's close but still not 'right', because it would give a false positive in the very rare case that the last line in the file is exactly as long as the maximum line limit.

But, you know, whatever :)

----------------------------------------------------

For RyanA - I simply compiled the 2 .c files as .cpp files by changing the extensions on them. I got one error on dictionary.cpp (because malloc returns a void * and t is a char * but fixed it by changing from:
t = malloc(strlen(s)+1) ;
to:
t = (char *)malloc(strlen(s)+1) ;

After that, no problems at all linking in to my .cpp program.
